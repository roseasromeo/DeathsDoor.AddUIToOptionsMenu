# Death's Door Add UI to Options Menu Mod
Adds UI elements to options menu in Death's Door by duplicating existing elements and reparenting them. Currently supports adding buttons with optional confirmation prompts and toggles. Strictly a dependency mod (i.e. adds nothing on its own).

## Installation
Unzip this mod into the plugins folder of your Death's Door BepInEx installation. See other mods for BepInEx installation instructions (since this mod is strictly a dependency).

## Purpose
Written to support https://github.com/Chris-Is-Awesome/DDArchipelagoRandomizer and https://github.com/roseasromeo/DeathsDoorReturnToSpawn. If you'd like to use this mod in your mod, please let me know! Right now, I'm only supporting my own use-cases, so I'm sure there's more possibility space out there.
